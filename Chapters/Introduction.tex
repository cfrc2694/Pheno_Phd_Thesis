The pursuit of a fundamental description of nature's building blocks and their interactions is a central endeavor of modern physics. This quest has led to the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, a quantum field theory that encapsulates our current understanding of the subatomic world. With breathtaking precision, the SM describes the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear forces and classifies all known elementary particles. Its triumphs are undeniable, crowned by the landmark discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012, which confirmed the mechanism for generating mass and represented the final piece of the SM puzzle.

Yet, for all its success, the Standard Model is universally acknowledged to be an incomplete theory. It offers no candidate for dark matter, cannot account for the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe, does not incorporate gravity, and leaves the mass of the Higgs boson itself unnaturally unstable under quantum corrections—a problem known as the hierarchy problem. These profound theoretical shortcomings provide a clear motivation for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). However, the most compelling guide for this search has always come from experimental data itself.

The primary mission of the LHC is not only to consolidate the SM but to probe its boundaries and discover new physics. While no direct evidence of new particles has been found so far, a series of subtle but persistent discrepancies—termed ``anomalies''—have emerged from experiments worldwide, suggesting a potential crack in the SM's foundation.

A particularly intriguing set of these anomalies points towards a violation of Lepton Flavor Universality (LFU). The SM predicts that the electroweak force couples with identical strength to the three charged leptons (electrons, muons, and taus), a fundamental principle known as LFU. The most significant and long-standing hints of LFU violation come from measurements of semileptonic $B$-meson decays. The ratios $R(D^{(*)}) = \mathcal{B}(B \to D^{(*)} \tau \nu_\tau) / \mathcal{B}(B \to D^{(*)} \ell \nu_\ell)$, where $\ell$ is a muon or electron, have been measured by the BaBar, Belle, and LHCb collaborations to consistently exceed the SM predictions by a combined significance of approximately $3\sigma$-$4\sigma$. This deviation suggests that $B$ mesons are more likely to decay to a final state containing a tau lepton than the SM allows, providing a compelling hint of new physics that couples preferentially to the third generation. Furthermore, the longstanding discrepancy in the muon's anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$), recently confirmed with increased precision by the Fermilab experiment, adds another layer of intrigue, as it also hints at new physics potentially coupled preferentially to the second generation.

While each anomaly individually requires careful scrutiny, their collective persistence has generated significant excitement, as they seem to point towards new physics that breaks lepton flavor universality, potentially involving enhanced couplings to heavier fermions.


The pattern of these LFU-violating anomalies has inspired a vast landscape of theoretical models extending the SM. A common thread among the most promising explanations is the introduction of new heavy particles that mediate interactions with non-universal couplings to the different generations of fermions. This generational hierarchy is crucial to evade tight constraints from precision measurements on electrons (first generation) while affecting processes involving muons and taus.

Prominent candidates for such new states include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Leptoquarks (LQs):} Bosons that can decay to both a quark and a lepton, offering a natural tree-level explanation for the $B$-decay anomalies, particularly for $R(D^{(*)})$.
    \item \textbf{$Z'$ Bosons:} New neutral vector bosons that could mediate flavor-changing neutral currents.
    \item \textbf{New Scalars:} Beyond the Higgs, such as the $\phi'$ scalar.
\end{itemize}

In this thesis, we contextualize and present two of our phenomenological studies that propose different strategies to probe new physics models, such as the $4321$~\cite{Florez2023} and $U(1)_{T^3_R}$~\cite{Qureshi:2024naw} models, which extend the SM particle content to explain the observed LFU violation. These models introduce new particles with preferential couplings to second and third-generation fermions, making them prime candidates for explaining the experimental anomalies.

The experimental challenge lies in probing these models at the LHC. The proposed new particles are often heavy, leading to low production rates, and their decay signatures are complex and overwhelmed by enormous Standard Model backgrounds. Discovering them requires not just more data but innovative analysis strategies that can maximize the sensitivity to these exotic and rare processes.

This thesis presents two dedicated phenomenological studies that propose and develop novel strategies to probe the $4321$ and $U(1)_{T^3_R}$ models at the LHC. The work is situated at the intersection of theoretical model-building and experimental high-energy physics.

The core methodology of this research involves:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Defining \textbf{benchmark scenarios} within each model, selecting specific mass points and coupling structures that explain the LFU anomalies while remaining experimentally viable.
    \item Using \textbf{Monte Carlo simulation} to accurately generate the hypothetical signal processes alongside the dominant SM background processes, emulating the run conditions of the LHC and the performance of the CMS detector.
    \item Performing a detailed analysis of the available experimental phase-space, employing advanced \textbf{Machine Learning (ML) techniques} to construct discriminators that optimally separate the rare signal events from the background.
    \item Deriving the \textbf{expected sensitivity} for each model, establishing the exclusion limits or discovery potential that the LHC experiments could achieve with the current dataset.
\end{enumerate}

The structure of this thesis is as follows. We begin by establishing the theoretical foundation with a review of the Standard Model in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 then details the experimental context, describing the LHC and the CMS detector, and introduces the general analysis techniques employed. The original phenomenological work of this thesis is presented in the subsequent chapters: Chapter 4 details a search for new physics in the process $pp \to t\bar{t}\mu^+\mu^-$, while Chapter 5 presents a search for vector leptoquarks in the process $pp \to \tau^+\tau^- + b\text{-jets}$. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes by summarizing our findings and discussing their implications for the field, along with an outlook on future prospects.
