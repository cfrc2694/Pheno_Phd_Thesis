\chapter{On Vectorial Leptoquarks Sensitivity at the LHC}\label{ch:vector_lq}
$ $

As suggested in the introduction of Ch.~\ref{ch:U1T3R}, the patterns of LFUV discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:LU} motivate the construction of gauge-complete theoretical frameworks that can naturally accommodate non-universal couplings to fermions. And, we could search hints of this extended gauge structure based on accidental symmetries of the SM. If we consider that for each SM generation is anomaly-free, we wonder if each one form a multiplet of a larger gauge group. This unification quark-lepton naturally leads to the presence of leptoquarks ($\lq$s) in the particle spectrum, mediating quark–lepton transitions~\parencite{Angelescu:2021lln}. This was followed by intense theoretical development aiming to explain the anomalies via $\tev$-scale $\lq$ exchange at tree level~\cite{Hiller:2014yaa,Gripaios:2014tna,Alonso:2015sja,Calibbi:2015kma,Fajfer:2015ycq,Bauer:2015knc,Becirevic:2016oho,Crivellin:2017zlb,DAmico:2017mtc,Hiller:2017bzc,Buttazzo:2017ixm,Becirevic:2018afm,Cornella:2019hct,Angelescu:2021lln,Belanger:2021smw,GINO_2022}.

Leptoquarks are hypothetical bosons carrying both baryon and lepton number, enabling them to interact simultaneously with a lepton and a quark. They are a common feature of SM extensions where quarks and leptons belong to the same multiplet. Besides the Pati–Salam model~\cite{Pati:1974yy}, typical examples include $SU(5)$ GUT scenarios~\cite{Georgi:1974sy}. They can also appear in theories with strong dynamics, such as compositeness~\cite{Schrempp:1984nj}. $\lq$s have exotic couplings that allow quark–lepton transitions, resulting in a rich and diverse phenomenology which naturally leads to multiple constraints. A particularly stringent one arises from proton decay, which pushes the $\lq$ mass close to the Planck scale unless baryon and lepton numbers are conserved. Even in models where these numbers are preserved, $\lq$s remain subject to a wide variety of experimental and phenomenological bounds~\cite{Leurer:1993em,Davidson:1993qk,Leurer:1993qx,Hewett:1997ce,Queiroz:2014pra,Dorsner:2016wpm}, including limits from meson mixing, electric and magnetic dipole moments, atomic parity violation tests, rare decays, and direct searches. The relative importance of these bounds is, however, highly model dependent.

Before the end of 2022, it was generally agreed that, within proposed single $\lq$ solutions, the only candidate capable of addressing all $\Bm$-meson anomalies simultaneously and surviving all other constraints was a vector $\lq$ ($U_1$), transforming as $({\bf 3},\,{\bf 1},\,2/3)$, and coupling mainly to third-generation fermions via $\bq\,\tau$ and $\tq\,\nu_\tau$ vertices~\cite{Buttazzo:2017ixm,Angelescu:2021lln}. Despite a recent re-analysis of $R_{K^{(*)}}$ data showing this ratio to be compatible with the SM prediction~\cite{LHCb:2022qnv,LHCb:2022zom,Greljo:2022jac,Ciuchini:2022wbq}, the solution to the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ anomaly remains an open question. This continues to be a valid motivation for the study of scenarios where new particles have preferential couplings to third-generation fermions. Thus, it is still of interest to continue exploring the possibility of observing the $U_1$ $\lq$ at the LHC~\cite{GINO_2022}.

As expected, the theoretical community has extensively participated in probing $\lq$ models by scrutinizing search strategies, recasting LHC results, and predicting the reach in the parameter space via different searches involving third-generation fermions (see for instance~\cite{Diaz:2017lit,Dorsner:2018ynv,PhysRevD.99.035021,Schmaltz:2018nls,Biswas:2018snp,Baker:2019sli,Haisch:2020xjd,Bhaskar:2021gsy,Bernigaud:2021fwn,CompositenessGurrola}). In addition, several $13 \tev$ searches for $\lq$s decaying into $\tq/\bq$ and $\tau/\nu$ final states have been performed by the CMS~\cite{CMS:2016fxb,CMS:2017xcw,CMS:2018svy,CMS:2018qqq,CMS:2018txo,CMS:2018iye,CMS:2020wzx,CMS:2022goy,LQS_CMS_2022_results_comparison} and ATLAS~\cite{ATLAS:2019qpq,ATLAS:2020dsf,ATLAS:2021oiz,ATLAS:2021yij,ATLAS:2021jyv,ATLAS_7A,ATLAS_Vertical_Line} collaborations.

Of the searches above, we find~\cite{CMS:2020wzx} particularly interesting. Here, the CMS collaboration explores signals corresponding to $\tq\,\nu\,\bq\,\tau$ and $\tq\,\nu\,\tau$ final states, with $137 \fb^{-1}$ of  $\mathrm{pp}$ collision data. The former is motivated by $\lq$ pair production, with one $\lq$ decaying into $\tq\,\nu$ and the other into $\bq\,\tau$, while the latter arises from a single $\lq$ produced in association with a $\tau$, with a subsequent $\lq$ decay into $\tq\,\nu$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:feynmp-prod-channels} for the corresponding diagrams). From the combination of both production channels, the search excludes $U_1$ masses under $1.3-1.7 \tev$, with this range depending on the $U_1$ coupling to gluons and on its coupling $g_U$ in the $\bq_L\,\tau_L$ vertex.

What makes this search particularly attractive is that, for the first time, an LHC collaboration directly places (mass dependent) bounds on $g_U$. This is important, since having information on this parameter is crucial in order to understand if the $U_1$ is really responsible for the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ anomaly. The inclusion of the single-$\lq$ production mode is important, since its cross-section is directly proportional to $g^2_U$. However, as can be seen in Figure~6 of~\cite{CMS:2020wzx}, the current constraints are dominated by pair production, with single-$\lq$ production playing a subleading role. While this is expected~\cite{Schmaltz:2018nls}, it still leads us to ponder the possibility of improving the sensitivity of LHC searches to single-$\lq$ production, and thus on achieving better constraints on $g_U$. Other complementary and similar searches to~\cite{CMS:2020wzx} were carried out by both ATLAS~\cite{ATLAS_7A} and CMS~\cite{LQS_CMS_2022_results_comparison}.

It is also well known, though, that searches for an excess in the high-$\pt$ tails of $\tau$ lepton distributions can strongly probe $g_U$, up to very large $\lq$ masses. Indeed, as shown in~\cite{Faroughy:2016osc,GINO_2022}, the new physics effective operators contributing to $R_D{^{(*)}}$ also contribute to an enhancement in the $\mathrm{pp}\to\tau\tau$ production rates. This has motivated a large number of recasts~\cite{Angelescu:2018tyl,Schmaltz:2018nls,Baker:2019sli,Bhaskar:2021pml,Angelescu:2021lln,Cornella:2021sby,Allwicher:2022gkm,Haisch:2022afh,GINO_2022}, as well as a CMS search explicitly providing constraints in terms of $U_1$~\cite{CMS:2022goy}. 

Nevertheless, it is important to note that for these $\mathrm{pp}\to\tau\tau$ processes, the $\lq$ participates non-resonantly, so contributions to the $\mathrm{pp}\to\tau\tau$ rates and kinematic distributions from non-LQ BSM diagrams containing possible virtual particles, such as a heavy neutral vector boson $\zb'$, could spoil a straightforward interpretation of any possible excess~\cite{Baker:2019sli}. For example, the $U(1)_{T^3_R}$ extension usually arises from larger gauge groups, such as the Pati–Salam model~\parencite{Pati:1974yy}, which unifies quarks and leptons in the same multiplet. 

Thus, it is also necessary to understand how the presence of other virtual particles can affect the sensitivity of an analysis probing $g_U$.

In this chapter we study the projected $\lq$ sensitivity at the LHC, considering already available $\mathrm{pp}$ data as well as the expected amount of data to be acquired during the HL-LHC runs. We explore a proposed analysis strategy which utilizes a combination of single-, double-, and non-resonant-LQ production, targeting  final states with varying $\tau$-lepton and b-jet multiplicities. 
The studies are performed considering various benchmark scenarios for different $\lq$ masses and couplings, also taking into account distinct chiralities for the third-generation fermions in the $\lq$ vertex. We also assess the impact of a companion $\zb'$, which is typical of gauge models, in non-resonant $\lq$ probes, and find that interference effects can have a significant effect on the discovery reach. We consider this effect to be of high interest, given that non-resonant $\lq$ production can have the largest cross-section, and thus could be an important channel in terms of discovery potential.

An important aspect of this chapter is that the analysis strategy is developed using a ML algorithm based on BDTs\cite{friedman_greedy_2001}. The output of the event classifier is used  to perform a profile-binned likelihood test to extract the overall signal significance for each model considered in the analysis. The advantage of using BDTs and other ML algorithms has been demonstrated in several experimental and phenomenological studies~\cite{Ai:2022qvs,Biswas:2018snp,ATLAS:2017fak,Chigusa:2022svv,Chung:2020ysf,Feng:2021eke,ttZprime}. In our studies, we find that the BDT algorithm gives sizeable improvement in signal significance.
