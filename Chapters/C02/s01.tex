\section{Experiments at Colliders}

When two particle bunches from colliding beams cross each other, they generate individual interactions known as events. 
At the LHC, the beam intensity is so high that multiple interactions can take place in a single event; this phenomenon is referred to as pile-up. 
These collisions occur at four main interaction points, each hosting a large particle detector designed to record and analyze the outcomes. 
Among them, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and ATLAS are the largest and most comprehensive experiments. Both are multipurpose detectors with broad physics programs, capable of exploring a wide range of phenomena. They perform precision measurements within the electroweak sector of the Standard Model, probe the dynamics of quarks and gluons (including through heavy-ion collisions), and conduct extensive searches for physics beyond the Standard Model using $pp$ collision data. 
While CMS and ATLAS differ in their detector designs and reconstruction strategies, their physics goals are largely overlapping, and their results are complementary. 
Throughout this work, phenomenological studies and comparisons are primarily developed in the context of CMS, although several results from ATLAS are also referenced, given the close alignment in sensitivity and scope. 

To fully describe the CMS experiment, some of its parameters should be outlined. Measurements performed at CMS adopt the coordinate system whose origin lies at the collision point, with the $y$-axis pointing vertically upward, the $x$-axis pointing radially inward towards the centre of the LHC and the $z$-axis along the beam direction. The azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured in the $x y$-plane from the $x$-axis and the polar angle, $\theta$, is measured from the $z$-axis, as shown in the Fig.~\ref{fig_coordinates}.

The event rate $R$ for a physical process (e.g., $pp \to X$) is governed by the accelerator's luminosity $\mathcal{L}$ and the process cross section $\sigma$. Luminosity quantifies the performance of a collider to produce interactions, establishing the proportionality,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d R}{d t} = \mathcal{L} \sigma,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ (typically measured in barns, $1\,\text{b} = 10^{-24}\,\text{cm}^2$) encodes the interaction probability. For LHC proton bunches colliding head-on with Gaussian transverse profiles, the instantaneous luminosity is~\parencite{Herr:941318,book:1123430}:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{f N_{b}}{4\pi} \frac{N_{1} N_{2}}{\sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}}\label{eq_lumi}
\end{equation}
Here, $N_{1,2}$ are proton counts per bunch, $f$ is the bunch collision frequency, $N_{b}$ is the number of bunches, and $\sigma_{x,y}$ are transverse beam widths. 

Integrating $\mathcal{L}$ over time yields the total integrated luminosity $L$, linking directly to the observed event count $N$:
\begin{equation}
	L = \int \mathcal{L}\, dt \quad \Rightarrow \quad N = L \sigma.
\end{equation}

%This major upgrade aims to increase the integrated luminosity by more than an order of magnitude, targeting up to $3\,\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$ of data per experiment. The HL-LHC will significantly enhance the sensitivity to rare processes, improve the precision of Standard Model measurements, and boost the discovery potential for BSM phenomena.

  
The Gaussian beam approximation in~\eqref{eq_lumi} ignores hourglass effects (beam divergence near interaction points) and dynamic $\sigma_{x,y}$ variations during fills. CMS mitigates these via real-time luminosity monitoring using pixel clusters~\parencite{Sirunyan2021}, with systematic uncertainties below $2\%$. High $\mathcal{L}$ also introduces pileup—multiple $pp$ interactions per bunch crossing—which complicates $\eta$/$\phi$ measurements but is corrected using vertex isolation algorithms.

The following variables are related to the particles being produced rather than the accelerator.
\begin{description}
	\item[Decay width] ( $\Gamma)$ The decay rate is the probability that a given particle will decay per unit time. Since a particle can have multiple decay modes, the total decay rate is the sum of the decay rates for each mode~\parencite{book:1123430}. The relative frequency of a decay mode is the branching ratio, given by
	$$
	\mathrm{BR}(j)=\frac{\Gamma(j)}{\Gamma} .
	$$
	\item[Cross-section] $(\sigma)$ The cross-section is a measure of the probability that an interaction will occur from a collision. It is a quantum-mechanical analogue of the "effective size" of the particles involved in an interaction.

	\item[Pseudo-rapidity] $(\eta)$ Instead of using the polar angle, CMS measurements involve the pseudo-rapidity, defined by
	$$
	\eta=-\ln \left(\tan \frac{\theta}{2}\right)
	$$
	The main advantage of using the pseudo-rapidity is that distributions over it tend to be closer to a uniform distribution than those over the polar angle, see Fig.~\ref{fig_cms_coor}. Furthermore, the difference in pseudo-rapidity is invariant under Lorentz boosts along the beam direction~\parencite{book:1123430}.
	\item[Transverse Momentum] ($p_T$) Refers to the component of momentum which is perpendicular to the beam line. It is usually preferred over full momentum because momentum along the beamline may just be left over from the beam particles, while the transverse momentum is always associated with whatever physics happened at the vertex, see Fig.~\ref{fig_cms_coor}.
	\item[Missing transverse energy and momentum] $\left(E_{T}^{\text {miss }} \& p_{T}^{\text {miss }}\right)$ Missing energy and momentum refers to the energy and momentum that is not detected but is expected to be there as a consequence of energy conservation and momentum conservation. This momentum is often carried by particles that do not interact electromagnetically or strongly and are therefore difficult to detect~\parencite{book:1123430}. Missing energy and momentum provides an indirect measurement of undetectable particles in hadron colliders such as neutrinos. Missing momentum reconstructions focus on the transverse direction, where total momentum is expected to be zero.
