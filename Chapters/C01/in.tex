\chapter{Standard Model of Particle Physics}

The standard model (SM) of particle physics is a quantum field theory (QFT) in which fundamental particles are excitations of interacting relativistic fields in the quantum vacuum~\parencite{greiner2000relativistic}. In this context, matter in nature is formed by particles that have a fermionic character, and their interactions are described by the gauge principle, where integer spin particles, defined as vector bosons from the adjoint representation of a symmetry group (\textit{gauge group}), are the messengers of the interaction~\parencite{pokorski2000gauge}.

Specifically, the SM characterizes interactions through the gauge principle, where force-carrying particles (integer spin vector bosons) originate from the adjoint representation of symmetry groups (\textit{gauge groups}) \cite{pokorski2000gauge}. This elegant formulation unifies three of the four fundamental forces in nature.

In this chapter, we contextualize the SM by introducing the basic concepts of quantum field theory, including the notion of fields and symmetries. We then present the particle content of the SM, its gauge group, and the Lagrangian density that describes its dynamics. Finally, we discuss the Higgs mechanism and its role in providing mass to the weak gauge bosons and fermions.
