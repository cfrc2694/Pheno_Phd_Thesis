\chapter{Standard Model of Particle Physics}

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a quantum field theory (QFT) that describes matter as fermionic particles and their fundamental interactions through the gauge principle. In this framework, force-carrying particles---vector bosons with integer spin, arising from the adjoint representation of symmetry groups (\textit{gauge groups})---mediate the interactions between matter particles~\parencite{greiner2000relativistic,pokorski2000gauge}. This elegant formulation unifies three of the four fundamental forces in nature.

In this chapter, we contextualize the SM by introducing the basic concepts of quantum field theory, including the notion of fields and symmetries. We then present the particle content of the SM, its gauge group, and the Lagrangian density that describes its dynamics. The Higgs mechanism and its role in providing mass to the weak gauge bosons and fermions are also discussed. Finally, we address the main deficiencies of the Standard Model and review the experimental evidence that motivates the search for physics beyond the SM.
